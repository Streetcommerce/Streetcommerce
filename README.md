Hello we are looking to create a app for Street Commerce using open source code and to later implement blockchain technology for data processing and payment methods & user control of data.
For now we are focusing on building the app for ios and launching it to our customers as a way to buy our product from anywhere with a mobile phone.
we have a website https://www.streetcommerce.shop/
we want to implement a wallet on the app for funds to be converted into refit tokens and usable instore- on app for purchases/ giveaway winnnings.
we are looking to collaborate on this project with like minded people who can help bring this project to life.
you can reach us at Street Commerce on instagram and twitter https://twitter.com/street_commerce
we are a 2 year old company started in charlotte nc by 2 brothers and have been rising in volume ever since.
By bringing this app to life we hope to give our customers a better online shopping experince and introduce our Refit program to the world.
